    # Balance note:
    # Original Undead Empire required 1 turn less to research farming & mining improvements
    # However, at turn start first auto-working was calculated, and afterwards research
    # inmprovements were applied, meaning that still the lower, old value was used to determine gold.
    # So, having research done first, and having in undead empire the same,
    # requirements for research will balance itself out.
