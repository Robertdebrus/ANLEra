Some hints, tweaks, tricks, easter eggs, gimmicks, â€¦:
- When removing allow_era= from the scenario file, it can be played with leaders from another era!
  (the same way like in mainline). The recruits will be like in mainline (Peasant & Mage).
  Downside: might now be you instead of the game, who has to guarantee that all use the same version.
- By negotiation with mermen one can get a builder for water fields.
- One can also get a merfolk mage, who can also research. Water based university exist too.
- When starting wesnoth with --debug, one can to some extend change enemy sides (prior to starting the match).
- When starting wesnoth with --debug, some cheats are available when clicking over forest terrain.
