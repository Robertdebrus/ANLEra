Dwarves have 1 move less, because they have minimum speed cost for mountains.
Zombies have 1 move less, because they will create a new unit if they can catch an escaping enemy.

From the table one can read:
Ruffian  = less hp, same damage
Woodsman = like Peasant, but for ranged
Citizen  = weaker
Miner    = stronger
Worker   = even stronger, but must heal a lot
Nomad    = hills have the role of forests, while sand and forests are like flat
Goblin   = a problem
Zombie   = like Peasant
