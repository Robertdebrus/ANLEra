Drakes:  workers with highest and lowest hitpoints
Dune:    different movetype, unit variations
Orcs:    highest damage

Level 1 goblins & zombies are also considered to be workers.

From the table one can read:
Ruffian  = less hp, same damage
Woodsman = like Peasant, but for ranged
Citizen  = weaker
Miner    = stronger, very vulnerable on flat & forests
Worker   = even stronger, but must heal a lot
Young    = ?
Nomad    = hills have the role of forests, while sand and forests are like flat
Goblin   = a problem
Zombie   = like Peasant
