#textdomain wesnoth-ANLEra

# This is THE file where the Wesnoth game engine looks for code.
# Everything happening needs to be set up here in one way or another.

# Wesnoth and this add-on make heavy use of pre-processing.
# Evertyhing with curly braces {} either
# - reads macro definitions from a file
# - or uses a defined macro, maning that it will "copy-paste"
#   the content from the definition to the place where the macro is used.

# To load an add-on, the remaining part of this file does the following:
# - pre-processor macros are read for the respective {./files.cfg}
# - when using these {macros}, they place WML code.
# - top-level WML [tags] need to be placed here,
#   and further WML code will be placed inside them.
