# Dunefolk work a bit different as faction, the stats for a base unit are not obvious.
# - Some units are lawful, some are liminal.
# - Dune Skirmisher is female, but this unit not, it should thus not advance to it.
# - Advancing to the mounted unit Dune Rider might be strange.

# Having 8 sprites in 3 art styles … can make a concept out of it:
# the 4 images in light colors -> lawful 6-2, resembles Soldier and Burner
# the 2 other images -> liminal 4-3, resembles Rover
# the 1 with shovel -> liminal 4-3 using impact, resembles Herbalist
# the 1 with sword -> earlier sprite, displayed in the help, resembling all

# Differences in movement types of possible advancements:
# Rover   -> defense on sand and forest is improved by 10% to 50%, no weakness to blade (instead -10%)
# Burner  -> 10% bonus against coldness
# Soldier -> defense on hills, mountains and villages is decreased to 50%,
#            mountains and swamp cost 1 more mp.
#            has blade resist (20% instead -10%) and pierce resist (20% instead of 0%)
#            weakness to impact (-10% instad 0%)
#
# Choosing for the L0 unit:
# 40% on sand and forests, 60% for hills and mountains
# Units from other faction have typically 50% on forest … dunefolk has instead a bonus on hills and sand.
# -10% weakness to blade

# wmllint: local spellings defence

After advancement, this unit can deal with the situation of low defence by having a higher resistance to blade and pierce attacks instead. Unless you advance it to another unit."
